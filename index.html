            <li>225g softened butter</li>
            <li>225g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Â½ lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>

        <h4>INSTRUCTION</h4>

            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. 
                Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. Whisk until just combined.</li>
            <li>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
